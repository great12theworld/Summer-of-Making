            <p>I want to open up this homepage by talking about where I come from and who I am
                as a person. My name, if you couldnt tell from the header, is Parth Sandip Patil.
                I love to program a large variety of things, from web development to game development
                and everything in between. I have a passion for learning new technologies and
                improving my skills as a developer. I am someone who loves to make music, do martial arts,
                and play video games. In my free time, I enjoy finding new hobbies and exploring new interests.
                I try to improve and learn at least one new thing every day, whether it be introducing myself to a new programming language,
                figuring out how to use a new tool, or even just reading a book on a topic I find interesting. Just talking
                small steps each day is something that will improve my daily life. I am a class of 2028 student at Mason High School,
                hoping to pursue a career in either computer science or information technology.
                I am excited to share my journey and experiences with you through this website. Thank you for visiting!
